3) Summarize :  " History of Pune - Pune, with roots tracing to an 8th-century settlement called Punnaka, became a significant Maratha Empire center under Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj and later the powerful Peshwa rulers, a period marked by growth and historical landmarks like Shaniwar Wada. After being conquered by the British in 1817, it served as their "monsoon capital". Post-independence, Pune emerged as a major economic hub and the cultural capital of Maharashtra, known today for its prestigious educational institutions, vibrant art and culture, and a thriving innovation scene."
